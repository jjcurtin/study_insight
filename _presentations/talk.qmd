## Self-monitoring during AUD recovery

[Self-monitoring]{.purple} is a tool to increase conscious awareness about one's own present or future behavior

:::{.notes}
Self-monitoring = insight = confidence/likelihood of behaviors

It can bring about awareness of current behaviors, but it can also encourage thinking about the likelihood of future behaviors
:::

## Self-monitoring during AUD recovery

[Self-monitoring]{.purple} is a tool to increase conscious awareness about one's own present or [future]{.yellow} behavior

:::{.notes}
In the case of alcohol use disorder (AUD), self-monitoring is often used to increase awareness about CURRENT RISK of FUTURE ALCOHOL USE, especially a return to drinking that is goal-inconsistent. For example, if someone's goal is abstinence, then they may wish to self-monitor risk of any alcohol use.
:::

## Self-monitoring during AUD recovery

- Self-monitoring is...
  - Encouraged by clinicians
  - Prompted by many self-help tools/apps/etc.
  - Considered to be a productive component of CBT in the treatment of substance use disorders

:::{.notes}
There is a strongly held belief that self-monitoring is valuable and even necessary tool during AND FOLLOWING treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and other substance use disorders. Often, self-monitoring is "prescribed" as a primary tool post-treatment as a way for individuals to determine whether they need to return to treatment or reach out for support. 
:::
## Static measurement

- Self-monitoring has traditionally been measured statically
  - Measures like the [Alcohol Abstinence Self-Efficacy Scale (AASE)]{.yellow} are often used to assess an individual's "long-term" likelihood of remaining abstinent
  - Scores from measures like the AASE may be used at the end of treatment/end of study/etc. to estimate an individual's future likelihood of staying abstinent

[It is unclear how well static measures like the AASE predict future lapse and relapse outcomes]{.purple}.

:::{.footer}
reference for AASE brief version
:::

## Recovery as a dynamic process

- Risk of lapse/relapse is best understood [dynamically]{.yellow}
  - Relapse prevention model has been updated to reflect dynamic processes
  - Fluctuating risk over time due to fluctuating proximal and distal risk factors that interact fluidly with one another
  
[Thus, self-monitoring dynamic risk of lapse likely requires dense, dynamic assessment to be effective]{.purple}

:::{.notes}
Static or one-time measurement stands in conflict with what we know about the dynamic relapse prevention model
:::

## Dynamic self-monitoring via EMA

- Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) offers a method by which individuals can self-monitor
  - [Densely]{.yellow}: assessment can happen as frequently as needed/desired
  - [Longitudinally]{.yellow}: assessment can happen throughout the ongoing process of recovery

:::{.notes}

## Purpose

[The purpose of this project is to determine whether [dynamic self-monitoring]{.purple} offers greater predictive value than [static (one-time) risk assessment]{.purple}.]{.centered}

<!--progress through brief explanations of each in second column
1. brief overview: put question back up, model built from single predictor (kept "raw") matched to outcome of the same 1-week window, did they actually lapse. model performance = index of accuracy of their predictions

2. compared that 1-predictor model to a model built from a single AASE measurement at study intake. 

3. built model using all EMA data from the same study period (i.e., all questions) with more advanced feature engineering techniques to predict same 1-week outcome windows. compared how well we can predict using this "full" model to the dynamic assessment only model (how much better can we do if we take all the data into account, what else does it allow us to do with the outcome [treatment recs])

## Dynamic self-monitoring via EMA

- Dynamic self-monitoring relied on a single EMA item:

> "How likely are you to drink alcohol in the next week?"

- Participants responded on a 1 - 11 Likert scale with the following anchors:
  - 1 Very unlikely
  - 4-5 Unlikely
  - 7-8 Likely
  - 11 Very likely

- This item appeared on an EMA sent 1X daily in the morning
- Participants provided EMA data for up to 3 months

## Outcome: Lapse

DEFINE LAPSE CLEARLY & JUSTIFY CHOICE
connect to sample w goal of abstinence, any drinking = goal-inconsistent
contrast to relapse nebulous

- Lapses were assessed via an additional EMA item:

> "Have you drank any alcohol that you have not yet reported?

- If participants answered yes to this question, they were prompted to enter:
  - The hour and date of the start of the drinking episode
  - The hour and date of the end of the drinking episode

## Lapse labels

- Our outcomes were [one-week windows]{.yellow} that began immediately following the submission of the morning EMA
  - Windows that contained any portion of a reported lapse were labeled as [lapse]{.purple}
  - Windows that did not contain a lapse were labeled as [no lapse]{.purple}

- Total N observations: 9845
  - Lapse: 2442 (24.8%)
  - No lapse: 7403 (75.2%)

## Model configurations

- Single predictor in each model: 
  - Dynamic self-monitoring: most recent self-monitoring score (no feature engineering)
  - Static risk assessment: AASE total score
- Outcome: next-week drinking

- Model configurations used the xgboost algorithm, various types of resampling, and sensible hyperparameter values

:::{.notes}
  - Algorithm xgboost (tree-based algorithm)
  - Upsampling, downsampling, SMOTE, and no resampling to adjust majority/minority class ratios
  - Sensible values for hyperparameters mtry, learning rate, and third??

## Model training, selection, and evaluation

::::{.columns}

:::{.column, width="50%"}
- Models are trained, selected, and evaluated using [nested k-fold cross-validation]{.yellow}

- Key details:
  - Training, selection, and evaluation happens in different data
  - Grouped by participant
  - Produces 30 independent estimates of model performance in new data
  
- Model performance evaluated on [area under the ROC curve (auROC)]{.yellow}

walk through CV illustration. highlight key points

describe auROC in plain terms

highlight that we have 30 held-out estimates from each model, so can compare performance using these independent estimates & bayesian approach, reference, tidymodels/tidyposterior methods
:::

## Analysis plan: Model performance comparisons

BAYESIAN METHODS DESCRIBE
again highlight key points

## Results: Dynamic vs. static self-monitoring

start with just AASE performance - some signal, unsurprising given extant literature and continued use in clinical practice!

then model comparison - but we can do SO UCH BETTER when we assess a dynamic process using dynamic measurement

## Takeaways

what did we learn

what can we do with this? not much --> full EMA

## Dynamic self-monitoring via EMA (UPDATE - this = WHY dynamic better)

> "How likely are you to drink alcohol in the next week?"

Self-monitoring was...
- [**Dynamic**]{.purple}: Assessments occurred [*daily*]{.yellow}
- [**Cued**]{.purple}: Individuals were [*prompted*]{.yellow} to reflect on their risk
- [**Contextualized**]{.purple}: Self-monitoring question was situated [within a 10-item EMA]{.yellow}
  - 6 questions assessing risk factors 
  - 2 additional questions monitoring future behavior
  - Self-monitoring item was the [*final*]{.yellow} item, requiring reflection on 9 relevant risk factors prior to answering
  
<!-- consider if this slide is better suited as part of conclusions? re: WHY dynamic self-monitoring works well & works better than static measurement? YES MOVE LATER -->

## EMA

more methods details here on EMA, all items

discuss 4x daily component & timing

## Feature engineering

## Analyses model comparisons purpose 3

## Results: Full EMA vs. self-monitoring alone


don't introduce dtx until after initial model comparison
cut first question separately, just do model comparison 2 and talk about individual performance as well as modelc omparison in those analyses

then dtx - what would we DO with that information? nothing. need context and solutions

- Continuous monitoring with EMA can be embedded within a digital therapeutic context that can allow:
  - Simultaneous monitoring of other risk factors
  - Access to supports and tools to be used throughout recovery
