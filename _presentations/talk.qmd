## Background...

## Nature of AUD

- AUDs/SUDs are problematic and prevalent, and they require lifelong care/monitoring

## Self-monitoring definition

- Self-monitoring = insight = confidence in remaining abstinent/pursuing treatment goals
- In our study: "How likely are you to drink alcohol in the next week?"

## Self-monitoring during AUD recovery

- There is a strongly held belief that self-monitoring is a valuable and necessary tool during recovery
  - Encouraged by clinicians
  - Prompted by many self-help tools/apps/etc.
  - Considered to be a productive component of CBT in the treatment of SUDs
  
- However, there is **insufficient evidence** and/or **insufficient nuance** to guide how monitoring should be implemented
  - Data are somewhat limited & findings are mixed (check Ariela's articles, not sure her reviews are exactly on-topic)

## Static measurement

- Self-monitoring has traditionally been measured statically
  - Measures like the AASE are often used to assess an individual's "long-term" likelihood of remaining abstinent
  - Scores from measures like the AASE may be used at the end of treatment/end of study/etc. to estimate an individual's future likelihood of staying abstinent

It is **unclear how well static measures like the AASE predict future lapse and relapse outcomes**.

## Dynamic process of relapse

Static or one-time measurement stands in conflict with what we know about the dynamic relapse prevention model

- Risk of lapse/relapse is best understood **dynamically**
  - Relapse prevention model
  - Fluctuating risk over time due to fluctuating proximal and distal risk factors that interact fluidly with one another
- Thus, *self-monitoring dynamic risk of lapse likely requires dense, dynamic assessment to be effective*

## EMA as a tool for dynamic assessment

- Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) offers a method by which individuals can self-monitor densely and longitudinally
- Continuous monitoring with EMA can be embedded within a digital therapeutic context that can allow:
  - Simultaneous monitoring of other risk factors
  - Access to supports and tools to be used throughout recovery



## Study Purpose

:::{.columns}

::::{.column width="50%"}
The purpose of this project was to determine:

1. How accurately individuals could self-monitor their risk of alcohol lapse in the next week

2. Whether dynamic self-monitoring offers greater predictive value than static risk assessment

3. Whether that models that take advantage of full EMA data and feature engineering can predict lapse risk more accurately than self-monitoring alone

## Mental Healthcare Needs are High and Unmet {.smaller}

- [In 2019, 52 million Americans had an active mental illness]{.yellow}
  - [More than half did not receive any treatment]{style="color: grey;"}


- [20 million]{.yellow} adults had an active substance use disorder
  - 9 out of 10 did not receive any treatment


::: {.notes}


And for the 20 million adults suffering with a substance use disorder, it was worse still.

**9 out of 10 without any treatment**
