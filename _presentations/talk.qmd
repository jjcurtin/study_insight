## Self-monitoring during AUD recovery

[Self-monitoring]{.yellow} is a tool to increase conscious awareness about one's own present or future behavior

::: {.notes}
Self-monitoring = insight = confidence/likelihood of behaviors

It can bring about awareness of current behaviors, but it can also encourage thinking about the likelihood of future behaviors
:::

## Self-monitoring during AUD recovery

[Self-monitoring]{.yellow} is a tool to increase conscious awareness about one's own present or [future]{.yellow} behavior

::: {.notes}
In the case of alcohol use disorder (AUD), self-monitoring is often used to increase awareness about CURRENT RISK of FUTURE ALCOHOL USE, especially a return to drinking that is goal-inconsistent. For example, if someone's goal is abstinence, then they may wish to self-monitor risk of any alcohol use.
:::

## Self-monitoring during AUD recovery

[Self-monitoring]{.yellow} is a tool to increase conscious awareness about one's own present or [future]{.yellow} behavior

Self-monitoring is...

- Encouraged by clinicians

- Included in many self-help tools/apps/etc.

- Considered to be a productive component of CBT in the treatment of substance use disorders

::: {.notes}
There is a strongly held belief that self-monitoring is valuable and even necessary tool during AND FOLLOWING treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD) and other substance use disorders. Often, self-monitoring is encouraged by clinicians as a primary tool post-treatment as a way for individuals to determine whether they need to return to treatment or reach out for support. It is also a key component of many self-help tools or apps, like via behavior tracking. We also know it is a key component of CBT for treating substance use disorders
:::

## Static measurement
::: {.incremental}
- Self-monitoring has traditionally been measured [statically]{.yellow}

  - These measures are often used to assess an individual's "long-term" likelihood of remaining abstinent
  
  - Scores from these measures may be used at the end of treatment/end of study/etc. to estimate an individual's future likelihood of staying abstinent

- It is unclear [how well static measures of future risk predict future lapse and relapse outcomes]{.yellow}.
:::

::: {.notes}
static = measured only once, or a single measurement is expected to assess risk for a very long period of time
:::

## Recovery as a dynamic process

::: {.incremental}
- Risk of lapse/relapse is best understood [dynamically]{.yellow}

  - Relapse prevention model has been updated to reflect dynamic processes
  
  - Fluctuating risk over time due to fluctuating proximal and distal risk factors that interact fluidly with one another
  
- Thus, self-monitoring dynamic risk of lapse likely requires [dense, dynamic assessment]{.yellow} to be effective
:::

::: {.notes}
START HERE Static or one-time measurement stands in conflict with what we know about the dynamic relapse prevention model

## Static risk assessment via AASE

- During an intake visit, participants completed the [Alcohol Abstinence Self-Efficacy Scale]{.yellow} ^[McKiernan et al. (2011). Development of a brief abstinence self-efficacy measure. *Journal of social work practice in the addictions.*] as a static risk assessment

::: {.incremental}
- 20-item version that comprises the [confidence domain]{.yellow} of the 40-item version

  - Measures an individual's *self-confidence about their ability to avoid drinking alcohol* in a variety of situations
  
  - Response options range from 0 ("Not at all") to 4 ("Extremely")
  
- Total score is calculated by summing all item scores
:::

::: {.notes}
4 subdomains re: different situations - negative affect (e.g., "When I am worried"), social (e.g., When I am being offered a drink in a social situation"), physical (e.g., "When I have a headache"), craving (e.g., "When I have the urge to try just one drink to see what happens")

## Outcome: Lapse

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="70%"}

- [Lapse]{.yellow}: A single instance of goal-inconsistent alcohol use

:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
Our outcome was lapse, which we defined as a single instance of goal-inconsistent use. As a reminder, our sample had a goal of abstinence, so any drinking was goal-inconsistent.

We chose to use lapse as our outcome because it is observable, has a temporally precise onset and offset, and is more clearly defined than a broader outcome like relapse. Lapses also always preceded relapse and can thereby be an early warning sign for intervention.

describe auROC in plain terms:
- how well our model can discriminate between lapse & no lapse cases
- auROC ranges from 0.5 (chance) to 1.0 (perfect prediction, every case correctly classified)
:::

## Analysis plan: Model performance comparisons

::: {.incremental}
- We used a [Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model]{.yellow} to estimate the posterior probability distributions around auROCs for the best models

  - Posterior probability: the likelihood *given our data*

- [Model performance]{.yellow}: posterior probability distributions around model performance --> do they include 0.5?

- [Model comparison]{.yellow}: probability (% chance) that one model performs better than another
:::

::: {.notes}
we have 30 held-out estimates from each model, so can compare these performance estimates using a bayesian hierarchical generalized linear model, following recommendations from the tidymodels team

these models produce posterior probability distributions, which are distributions of the likelihood of the model's performance given our data

to determine whether a model has predictive signal, we can see whether that posterior probability distribution includes 0.5 (chance performance)

we can also compare these distributions from our two models to determine the probability that one model performs better than another
:::

## Results: Dynamic vs. static self-monitoring

{{< embed ../notebooks/ana_bayes_insight.qmd#fig-post-model-sm >}}

::: {.notes}
we can start by comparing each model against 0.5 (chance performance) to see if there is signal - essentially looking to see if posterior distribution includes 0.5 or not

AASE performance - some signal, unsurprising given extant literature and continued use in clinical practice! Individuals can predict their lapses on-study slightly more accurately than chance performance

dynamic self-monitoring allows our participants to do SO MUCH better! 99.99% chance that this dynamic model predicts better than the static risk model. makes sense because we are assessing a process that we know to be dynamic. they can now quite accurately predict their alcohol use in the coming week

contextualize ~.2 increase as 40% of possible auROC change - that's a HUGE effect size!
:::

## Takeaways

::: {.incremental}
- Individuals can predict their likelihood of future alcohol lapses at study intake (via the AASE) better than chance but with very low accuracy --> [Insufficient for prediction and clinical utility]{.yellow}

- When participants can self-monitor dynamically, they can predict their risk of lapsing in the next week quite accurately

- *Why* was self-monitoring via EMA so much more accurate?

  - **Dynamic**: Assessments occurred [*daily*]{.yellow}
  
  - **Cued**: Individuals were [*prompted*]{.yellow} to reflect on their risk

- When participants can self-monitor dynamically, they can predict their risk of lapsing in the next week quite accurately

- *Why* was self-monitoring via EMA so much more accurate?

  - **Dynamic**: Assessments occurred [*daily*]{.yellow}
  
  - **Cued**: Individuals were [*prompted*]{.yellow} to reflect on their risk
  
  - **Contextualized**: Self-monitoring question was situated [within a 10-item EMA]{.yellow}
    - 9 questions about specific risk factors
    - Self-monitoring item was the [*final*]{.yellow} item, requiring reflection on 9 relevant risk factors prior to answering
  
## Application: How can we use this?

::: {.incremental}
- [There is value]{.yellow} in knowing that individuals can self-monitor their risk of returning to alcohol use quite accurately *when self-monitoring is dynamic, cued, and contextualized*

  - Supports the long-believed value of self-monitoring with empirical evidence
  
  - Adds nuance regarding the need for dynamic assessment of risk and outcome
  
  - Might be empowering to individuals! 
  
- From an implementation standpoint, [we cannot do much with predictions based solely on self-monitoring]{.yellow}
:::

::: {.notes}
Relatively good prediction but perhaps not yet good enough

Does not offer guidance as to what to DO next - no information about why they're at risk (or not at risk), what's going on, what's worsening or improving
:::

## Purpose {.larger}

\

\

\

[Can we obtain [more accurate, more clinically useful predictions]{.yellow} by taking advantage of additional EMA data?]

::: {.notes}
We will build a model using all the EMA data from all items on the 4x daily surveys as inputs but with the same 1-week windows as outcomes. We'll follow our same model comparison approach and see what we gain with these additional data.
:::

## Model training, selection, & evaluation

::: {.incremental}
- Predictors in each model: 

  - [Static risk]{.yellow}: total AASE score only

  - [Dynamic self-monitoring]{.yellow}: most recent self-monitoring score
  
  - [All EMA]{.yelllow}: all items from 4X daily EMA surveys

- Outcome: next-week drinking

- Same model training procedure using cross-validation to produce 30 independent estimates of model performance

- Same approach to evaluate and compare model performance across models
::: 

::: {.notes}
we fit this full-feature model using the same nested CV process that produced 30 independent estimates of model performance. then, just like we were able to compare the static and dynamic risk models, we compared this full ema model to our model that used only dynamic self-monitoring. i'll present the results to you in the same way
:::

## Results: All EMA features vs. self-monitoring alone

{{< embed ../notebooks/ana_bayes_insight.qmd#fig-post-model-all >}}

::: {.notes}
re-anchor in auROC. talk about probabilities that one model is better than the other. re-anchor across 3 model performance
:::

## Application: How can we use this?

::: {.incremental}
- With more EMA data included as features:

  - Model performance becomes sufficiently accurate for clinical implementation
  
  - Predictions become sufficiently contextualized so as to be clinically useful
  
- This is especially true if we [embed continuous monitoring with EMA into a digital therapeutic]{.yellow}

- A digital therapeutic could simultaneously:

  - Monitor multiple risk factors (e.g., using EMA surveys)
  
  - Provide feedback on risk levels and contributing factors
  
  - Offer access to tools and supports within the app
  
  - Recommend modules that address personally relevant risk factors
  
:::

## Conclusions

::: {.incremental}
- Though above chance performance, individuals can predict ongoing risk of lapse during recovery using static assessment with extremely low accuracy

- Dynamic self-monitoring via EMA allows individuals to predict changing next-week lapse risk relatively accurately

  - ... when self-monitoring is cued and contextualized
  
- Incorporating additional EMA data...

  - Improves prediction accuracy
  
  - Offers context about contributing risk factors
  
  - Creates a model that is well-positioned for use within a digital therapeutic context

:::

<!-- 
static model will CONTINUE to degrade over time

more images - eg putting up ema question for sm, dynamic lapse risk from john's presentations, graphical representation of demographics

labels - more general. whether they lapsed in the next week after each survey, the end

ema - introduce everything upfront, or at least more context. frame as why dsm = contextualized

in addition to getting probabilities, there are techniques that can identify the immportance of different predictors to affecting probabilities. can affect globally or at an observation level. then we could know which risk factors were contributing & select interventions to target those risk factors - cut dtx discussion, replace with what does this model give us & why iis that more clinically useful? use example risk factor paired with treatment module

clearer "in the top panel in red"

contextualize dsm item in abstinence sample
